# Healthcare Agent Orchestrator
Healthcare Agent Orchestrator is a multi-agent accelerator that coordinates modular specialized agents across diverse data types and tools like M365 and Teams to assist multi-disciplinary healthcare workflows—such as cancer care. 

This repository contains comprehensive information to help you get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
Healthcare Agent Orchestrator is a code sample to help you build an agent intended for research and development use only. Healthcare Agent Orchestrator is not designed or intended to be deployed in clinical settings as-is nor is it intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health or medical condition, and its performance for such purposes has not been established. By using the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator sample, you are acknowledging that you bear sole responsibility and liability for any use of Healthcare Agent Orchestrator, including verification of outputs and incorporation into any product or service intended for a medical purpose or to inform clinical decision-making, compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, and obtaining any necessary clearances or approvals.

## Features

- Demonstrates the use of the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator for solving complex tasks.
- Facilitates modular and scalable agent-based solutions for diverse healthcare needs.
- Provides tools for creating and managing specialized agents for specific tasks.
- Showcases the application of multi-model AI in healthcare scenarios.

## Solution Architecture
![Solution Architecture](media/architecture.png)

For each agent defined in `agents.yaml`, an Azure bot and associated Teams app are created. These are integrated into Semantic Kernel's group chat feature, allowing a group of experts to collaboratively solve tasks. Each agent has access to a set of tools. New agents can be added by updating `agents.yaml` and redeploying the application.

## AI Agent Role Summaries

- Orchestrator: Facilitates the conversation between the user and all expert agents. Determines the order of responses, gathers required information, and ensures agents yield control back after completing their tasks.
- Patient History: Loads and presents the patient's full clinical timeline using structured data tools. Answers questions about medical history but does not interpret images or make clinical recommendations.
- Radiology: Analyzes chest x-ray images using the CXRReportGen model and compares findings to the patient's history. Does not support other imaging modalities like CT or pathology.
- Patient Status: Provides a structured summary of the patient’s current clinical status including stage, biomarkers, and performance score. Requests missing details from PatientHistory if needed.
- Clinical Guidelines: Generates a structured treatment plan based on patient status using clinical guidelines and biomarker rationale. Recommends therapy adjustments and progression contingencies.
- Report Creation: Compiles a comprehensive tumor board Word document using all previously gathered information. Does not summarize or interpret; simply assembles validated agent outputs.
- Clinical Trials: Searches for and presents relevant clinical trials based on patient characteristics and prior treatments. Filters only for trials the patient is eligible for and formats them clearly.
- Medical Research: Retrieves research-backed insights using Microsoft GraphRAG. Responses include unaltered source references and links, focusing strictly on verified data.

## Getting Started

To get started with using our code sample for multi-agent workflows, follow the instructions below to set up your environment and run the sample application.

### Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in order. Each step builds on the previous ones, and jumping ahead may require restarting deployments that can take significant time to complete. Detailed documentation is linked for each step if you need additional context.

- An Azure subscription with:
    - Azure OpenAI: 100k Tokens per Minute of Pay-as-you-go quota for GPT-4o or GPT-4.1
    - Optionally access to a reasoner model such as GPT-o3-mini
    - GPU resources for one of the following:
        - NCADSA100v4 Family: 24 cores (one instance of Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4), or
        - NCADSH100v5 Family: 40 cores (one instance of Standard_NC40ads_H100_v5)
    - Azure App Services: Available VM quota - P1mv3 recommended
    - A resource group where you have _Owner_ permissions for deployment (subscription- level owner permissions is OK too)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-linux)
- Python 3.12 or later (for running locally)

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites (Quota & Permissions)

Before deploying, verify your Azure subscription has sufficient quota and your account has the necessary permissions to avoid resource limitations during deployment.

**Resource Requirements:**

* **Azure OpenAI and GPU Quota**
  - Ensure you have quota for either **GPT-4o** or **GPT-4.1** models (`GlobalStandard`) in your `AZURE_GPT_LOCATION` region (recommended: 100K-200K TPM)
  - Confirm availability of at least **24 cores** of NCADSA100v4 for `Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4` VM or **40 cores** of NCADSH100v5 for `Standard_NC40ads_H100_v5` VM in your `AZURE_HLS_LOCATION` region
  - The [Azure AI Management Center](https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/quota) is a helpful tool for this.
  - Note: GPU quota has two levels - subscription quota and ML workspace quota. Both must have available capacity. The AI Management Center link above manages ML workspace quotas.  

* **App Service Capacity**
  - Verify App Service quota in your `AZURE_APPSERVICE_LOCATION` region:
    ```sh
    az quota list --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/providers/Microsoft.Web/locations/<region> --output table --query "[].{Name:properties.name.localizedValue, Quota:properties.limit.value, Unit:properties.unit}"
    ```
  - Ensure sufficient capacity for P1mv3 App Service Plan
  - Note: Quota displays show limits only, not current usage. Check existing deployments to confirm available capacity.

**Required Permissions:**

* **Azure Resource Access**
  - You need **Owner** rights on at least one resource group
  - If you lack subscription-level owner permissions, ask your IT administrator to:
    - Create a resource group for you
    - Grant you the **Owner** role on that specific resource group
    - Use that resource group in **Step 3**.

* **Teams Integration**
  - Ensure your IT admin allows custom Teams apps to be uploaded—see [Teams app upload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload)


### Step 2: Create an `azd` Environment & Set Variables

Now use the region values you identified in [Step 1](#step-1-verify-prerequisites-quota--permissions) where you confirmed quota availability.

If you've identified single region for deployment, you can proceed to authentication. Otherwise, use the following table to set locations where you have quota/capacity available.

| Variable | Purpose | Default Value |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| AZURE_LOCATION | Primary location for all resources | Defaults to resource group region |
| AZURE_HLS_LOCATION | Region for GPU resources | Defaults to `AZURE_LOCATION` |
| AZURE_GPT_LOCATION | Region for GPT resources | Defaults to `AZURE_LOCATION` |
| AZURE_APPSERVICE_LOCATION | Region for App Service deployment | Defaults to `AZURE_LOCATION` |
| GPU_INSTANCE_TYPE | GPU SKU for model deployment | Defaults to `Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4` |


First, authenticate with Azure services:
```sh
# Log in to Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI
az login                 # add -t <TENANT_ID> if needed
azd auth login           # add --tenant <TENANT_ID> if needed
```

Create a new environment with a short name:
```sh
# Create environment (keep name ≤ 8 characters for best results)
azd env new <envName>
```

Configure region settings (only set values that differ from your main `AZURE_LOCATION`):

```sh
# Configure specific regions where you have quota (only needed if different from AZURE_LOCATION)
azd env set AZURE_HLS_LOCATION <hls-region>
azd env set AZURE_GPT_LOCATION <gpt-region>
azd env set AZURE_APPSERVICE_LOCATION <region>

# Override GPU instance type (only needed if not using the default Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4)
azd env set GPU_INSTANCE_TYPE Standard_NC40ads_H100_v5
```

> [!NOTE] 
> If you want to setup the research agent with Graph Rag, see more information in the [User Guide](./docs/user_guide.md#configuring-research-agent)

### Step 3: Deploy the Infrastructure

Now that your environment is set up, you can deploy all the necessary resources and infrastructure for the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deploying the infrastructure will create Azure resources in your subscription and may incur costs.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Ensure you have completed **Step&nbsp;1** and **Step&nbsp;2** before you proceed. Deploying the infrastructure can take a long time, and fixing errors after an incomplete or failed deployment is often even more time-consuming. Double-check your quotas, permissions, and environment variables now to avoid lengthy troubleshooting later.

To start the deployment process, run:

```bash
azd up
```

During deployment you will be prompted for the following information if not provided in the environment:

- You’ll be prompted for subscription, region, and resource group.  
- Pick **User** as the principal type.  
- Quota tip: 100 tokens/min is enough; 200 gives faster responses.

This command will provision all required Azure resources according to your environment settings, deploy the application code, and configure the necessary connections between components.

> [!TIP]
> For persistent deployment issues, use `azd down --purge` to completely reset your environment and avoid complications from Azure's soft-delete behavior by manually deleting the resource group.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The full deployment can take 20-30 minutes to complete. If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, see the [Troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md#deploy-the-infrastructure) for common deployment problems and solutions.

### Step 4: Install the Agents in Microsoft Teams

Now that your infrastructure is deployed, you need to install the agents in Microsoft Teams to interact with them:

For bash users:
```sh
# From repo root
./scripts/uploadPackage.sh ./output <teamsChatId|meetingLink> [tenantId]
```

For PowerShell users:
```powershell
# From repo root
.\scripts\uploadPackage.ps1 -directory ./output -chatOrMeeting <teamsChatId|meetingLink> [-tenantId <tenant-id>] 
```

During this process:
- You'll need a Teams **chat ID** or meeting link where the agents will be installed
- To get a chat ID, follow the instructions in [docs/teams.md#get-chat-id](./docs/teams.md#get-chat-id)


> [!TIP] 
> See the [Teams documentation](./docs/teams.md) for detailed instructions on finding chat IDs, creating Teams meetings for agents, and managing agent permissions within your Microsoft Teams environment.

> [!TIP] 
> If you encounter errors during agent installation or Teams integration, check the [Troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md#install-the-agents-in-microsoft-teams) for common issues and solutions related to package uploads, permissions, and Teams app installation.


### Step 5: Test the Agents inside Teams

See the [User Guide](./docs/user_guide.md) for a more complete guide, the most important commands are:
```
@Orchestrator clear                  # Reset conversation state
```

To start a tumor board review, try:
```
@Orchestrator Can you start a tumor board review for Patient ID: patient_4?
``` 

You can interact with any of the agents:
```
@PatientHistory create patient timeline for patient id patient_4
@PatientHistory can you tell me more about when chemotherapy happened relative to the KRAS mutation?
```

> [!TIP] 
> For detailed instructions on testing agents with sample scenarios and troubleshooting tips, see the [User Guide](./docs/user_guide.md).

### [Optional] Uninstall / Clean-up

To completely remove all deployed resources and clean up your environment, run:

```sh
azd down --purge
```

This command will permanently delete all Azure resources created during deployment, including resource groups, managed identities, storage accounts, endpoints, and other associated services.
